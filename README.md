# PhoneSearchNoMatchMsg
This AJAX project allows searching and generates a "no match" message if no search results are found.

The objective/specs for this project were as follows:

Create an HTML document that uses AJAX and Perl scripts. 
Make it so that if there is no name that matches the one searched, the user will be informed as such. 
For example, if the user searches for Annie, then the user should be informed that no matches were found.
